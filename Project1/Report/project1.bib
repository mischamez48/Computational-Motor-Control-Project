	abstract = {During development, all animals undergo major adaptations to accommodate behavioral ﬂexibility and diversity. How these adaptations are reﬂected in the changes in the motor circuits controlling our behaviors remains poorly understood. Here, we show, using a combination of techniques applied at larval and adult zebraﬁsh stages, that the pattern-generating V0d inhibitory interneurons within the locomotor circuit undergo a developmental switch in their role. In larvae, we show that V0d interneurons have a primary function in highspeed motor behavior yet are redundant for explorative swimming. By contrast, adult V0d interneurons have diversiﬁed into speed-dependent subclasses, with an overrepresentation of those active at the slowest speeds. The ablation of V0d interneurons in adults disrupts slow explorative swimming, which is associated with a loss of mid-cycle inhibition onto target motoneurons. Thus, we reveal a developmental switch in V0d interneuron function from a role in high-speed motor behavior to a function in timing and thus coordinating slow explorative locomotion. Our study suggests that early motor circuit composition is not predictive of the adult system but instead undergoes major functional transformations during development.},

	abstract = {Proprioception is essential for behavior and provides a sense of our body movements in physical space. Proprioceptor organs are thought to be only in the periphery. Whether the central nervous system can intrinsically sense its own movement remains unclear. Here we identify a segmental organ of proprioception in the adult zebraﬁsh spinal cord, which is embedded by intraspinal mechanosensory neurons expressing Piezo2 channels. These cells are late-born, inhibitory, commissural neurons with unique molecular and physiological proﬁles reﬂecting a dual sensory and motor function. The central proprioceptive organ locally detects lateral body movements during locomotion and provides direct inhibitory feedback onto rhythmgenerating interneurons responsible for the central motor program. This dynamically aligns central pattern generation with movement outcome for efﬁcient locomotion. Our results demonstrate that a central proprioceptive organ monitors self-movement using hybrid neurons that merge sensory and motor entities into a uniﬁed network.},

abstract = {The transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was a key development in vertebrate evolution. We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this.}}
